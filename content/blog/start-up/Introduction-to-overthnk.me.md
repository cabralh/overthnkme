# Introduction

I tend to have a lot of thoughts, as we all do. 

I want to use this platform as a means of writing about what I would rather not say.

This is a space for me to empty out, free of judgment and thought. Also because it helps to unload thoughts, allowing room for new ones to come about.

For me, writing helps bring clarity to past experiences that I couldn't reach through venting or deep-talks.

***It's exhausting to keep things to yourself sometimes. Other times, it warrants itself the safer choice.***

Clearly the current state of the world has everyone in better mental spirits so being able to offload some tension is better than repressing it.

Anyways, this is an open canvas I am painting in public for all to see. Maybe it'll inspire you too to find answers as I hope to.
