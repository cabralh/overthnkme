For the first time, I realized what I had longed for didn't matter. What I had once strived for thru long-winded connections was a cover-up, a fallacy.

What I longed for once was to be part of a growing community of people who helped others achieve greater health.

>To restore health and allow for one to live a healthier life.

I thought in order to make a change in the world, I needed to be in this clan of professions who helped to find cures to diseases or work on prosthetic designs to help mobilize the immobile.

*I don't want to say I quickly realized because this has been going on for about a decade.*

I will say that I don't need to do any of this or that.

For that matter, to help someone no matter how is enough for me.

*It is more than enough for me, in fact.*

## Fallacy
I grew up with the idea that in order to make a change in the world, healthcare was the only way. My career has lead me into healthcare but ever so longing for more.

I don't see myself remaining here forever. I think I am more useful on other projects, other ideas, other technologies that benefit humanity in different ways.

As I mentioned before, it took a long time to reach this thought. The current state of the world has allowed for massive introspection alongside my already introverted, reflective self.

Nevertheless, it was now.

## Current
Now I knew what I wanted for the next chapter of my life. I could see in front of me, with not so vivid detail. But that was okay.

That is okay for me. I can due with what I have and can envision. I think the future is brighter now having accepted what I found.

I can take control and dictate where I want my next steps to be.
