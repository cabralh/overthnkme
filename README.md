## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

I wanted to get experience building a relatively straight forward blog using `Gatsby` and `GraphQL` so here we are. This blog is a thought space where I write down what I think about most.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
